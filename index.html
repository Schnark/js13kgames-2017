<h1>I’ve lost my parents!</h1>
<ul>
<li>Help children to find their parents they have lost on a crowded beach!</li>
<li>Read the description and click on the person that matches it.</li>
<li>If you really can’t find a lost parent, you can skip it, but don’t do this too often. You’ll automatically skip if you can’t find the missing parent after 3 tries.</li>
<li>Find as many lost parents as possible in 3 minutes.</li>
<li>You can get extra points for finding some special items. They are rare, but you’ll probably recognize them when they turn up. Try to find at least 10 of them.</li>
<li id="too-small">You should make your browser window larger if that’s possible.</li>
